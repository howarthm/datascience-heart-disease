## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using heart disease data to better understand:

1. Can I use a subset of the tests that are more readily available like blood pressure?
2. Would women benefit from having a separate model trained from a subset of the dataset?
3. Can I predict heart disease accurately with the data?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one jupyter notebook (heart.ipynb) and a CSV (heart.csv) file of the Kaggle/UC Irvine dataset.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@markhowarth_35659/this-is-why-health-numbers-matter-c9a515f05e9c).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).  The code is free for anyone to use.
